This code captures information for six teams, stores this information on the server, and writes the data to the page. 
It includes delete buttons for each team, though the delete method is not currently working. Click the Update Schedule 
button, and the games schedule appears with text boxes for entering scores. After entering the scores, click the update 
results button, and a function evaluates which team has won and lost. We have attempted to write this information 
back to the server to be added to the original team information, however, at present, it is writing a new, undefined 
team instead! Future goals for this project include: getting the wins and losses to write back to the server properly, 
updating the scores of individual games by clicking the score button, rather than updating them all at the same time, 
and adding a sorting feature to the team stats.

Steve and I worked in different files for this project, because we felt that writing our own code would better 
faciliate the learning process for both of us. We constantly shared ideas and helped each other over each hurdle. 
Ultimately code will be merged as we get closer to full functionality.
